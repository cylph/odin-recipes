    <h2>Pizza Recipe</h2>
    <h3>A dough shaped into a circular disc and covered with sauce and cheese and thrown into a stone oven</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ball of pizza dough</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour for dusting</li>
        <li>Semolina flour for dusting</li>
        <li>¼ cup basic pizza sauce</li>
        <li>3 ounces shredded low-moisture mozzarella</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp.</li>
        <li>Serve after resting for a few minutes</li>
    </ol>
